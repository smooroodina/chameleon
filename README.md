Color changing image generator using Python OpenCV.  
The resulting video(.mp4) can be used as a **lock screen** on **Android** phones.  
<br>
Codec used to create mp4: **'H264'**  
> To use this codec, you need to include this file in your project path: **"openh264-1.8.0-win64.dll"**  
> from https://github.com/cisco/openh264/releases  
> (only 1.8.0 version works!!)  
> If you apply any other codec, in some cases it may not play depending on the device.


also you can make it into a **gif** file.
